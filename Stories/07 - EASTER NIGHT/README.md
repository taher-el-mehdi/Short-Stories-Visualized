# Anyuta â€“ A Short Story by Anton Chekhov

This project is a multimedia adaptation of Anton Chekhovâ€™s short story **Anyuta**, presented through a narrated video with accompanying visuals.

Chekhovâ€™s *Anyuta* tells the story of a quiet, hardworking young woman living with a struggling medical student. Itâ€™s a powerful reflection on silence, poverty, and emotional detachment â€” set in the claustrophobic world of a dingy student apartment.

## ðŸ“¸ Image Generation Attempt
The project originally attempted to generate cover art and supporting visuals using AI image generation tools like **DALLÂ·E**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Prompt Example (did not work as expected):

> A small, dimly lit 19th-century Russian student room with frosted windows and mismatched furniture. A pale young woman in simple clothes sits quietly by the window on a wooden stool, focused on embroidery. In the background, a young man in a vest paces the room reading from a medical book. The room is slightly cluttered â€” books, old dishes, thread, and paper scattered around. The mood is quiet and melancholic.

This prompt **did not yield satisfying results** due to several limitations:

- AI models tend to struggle with **fine composition and character emotion**  
- Generated images often lacked the **right historical tone or subtle expression**  
- Layouts were inconsistent (e.g., missing window, wrong character placement)  

ðŸ§ª As a result, generation was **moved to Copilot (draw) or manual illustration** tools for better control and accuracy.
