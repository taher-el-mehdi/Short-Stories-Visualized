# The Huntsman  
A solitary huntsman wanders along a sunlit clearing, where he unexpectedly meets a pale, shy woman from his past. Through their brief and emotionally charged conversation, Chekhov masterfully explores themes of love, regret, and detachmentâ€”all in a single moment of encounter.

### clean_story.py  
This script processes raw story text files by **cleaning their content** and saving the cleaned versions into a **parallel structure**.

## ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s Next?  
* I would **generate only one complete audio file** from the cleaned story.
* But I discovered that **ChatGPT (and related models)** only accept around **2,000 tokens** per prompt.
* âœ… **Next step:** Build a function to **automatically divide long stories into chunks** of \~2,000 tokens or less before sending them for narration generation.
* ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Avoid having to manually split the story or generate multiple audio files unless needed.
